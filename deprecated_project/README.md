At the beginning of the semester the course was taught under Professor Tim Ohanekwu.
Due to breach on contract, Professor Ohanekwu was dismissed from his position and
was replaced by Professor Janet Leahy. Upon this change of leadership, all students
were instructed to cease work on the class final project as outlined by Professor
Ohanekwu. A new final project outline was provided by the new professor and is what
the main contents of this repo are for.

All contents in this directory pertain to the old project and will not be completed
further, but remain to maintain completeness of the situation.
